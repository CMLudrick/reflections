How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It highlighted the specific line.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If you make a mistake you can revert to a previous version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The saves can take place at logical places

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Because you with programming different files interact with each other, but documents saved on google docs are generally self contained.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    to see when changes were made with descriptions of the changes, and then view the differences in those changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

   	you can revert to a previous version that is free of errors! and you can go back and check when the errors were introduced


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    version control on my project
